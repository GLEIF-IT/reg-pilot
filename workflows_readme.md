## Quick Start Guide

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd signify-ts-test
npm install
```

2. Start verification services:
```bash
docker compose up verify -d

```

# Credential Issuance Workflow and Configuration Documentation

## Overview

This functionality provides generalized workflows and configurations for issuing credentials. It allows users to define custom configurations to manage credential issuance processes flexibly.

## Requirements
    
*   **Prerequisites**:
    
    1.  Run `npm install` in the `signify-ts-test` directory to install dependencies.
        
    2.  Start the verification services:
     ```bash
     docker compose up verify -d
     ```
        

## Configuration and Workflow Setup

The configurations and workflows are located in the following directories:

- **Configurations**: `signify-ts-test/src/config`
- **Workflows**: `signify-ts-test/src/workflow`
    

### Configuration Files

Configuration files define the credential types, agents, and identifiers used in the workflow. Let's take as an example the `configuration-singlesig-single-user.json` configuration file, the setup includes:

1.  **Secrets**: Specifies private keys for various agents for credential issuance.

    ```json
    "secrets": {
        "gleif1": "D_PbQb01zuzQgK-kDWjq5",
        "qvi1": "BTaqgh1eeOjXO5iQJp6m5",
        ...
    }
    ```
    
2.  **Agents**: Each agent is linked to a secret, representing an entity that can issue credentials.

    ```json
    "agents": {
        "gleif-agent-1": {
            "secret": "gleif1"
        },
        "qvi-agent-1": {
            "secret": "qvi1"
        },
        ...
    }
    ```
    
3.  **Identifiers**: Each identifier here is and AID description associated with an agent.

    ```json
    "identifiers": {
        "gleif-aid-1": {
            "agent": "gleif-agent-1",
            "name": "gleif-aid-1"
        },
        "qvi-aid-1": {
            "agent": "qvi-agent-1",
            "name": "qvi-aid-1"
        },
        ...
    }
    ```
    
4.  **Credentials**: Defines credential types with parameters like schema, privacy, and attributes.

    ```json
    "gleif_to_qvi_vlei_cred": {
        "type": "direct",
        "schema": "QVI_SCHEMA_SAID",
        "privacy": false,
        "attributes": {}
    }
    ```
    
5.  **Users**: The users section lists users and associates them with identifiers. Each user is defined by their type and alias, mapping to a list of identifiers to facilitate their participation in credential issuance.

    ```json
    "users": [
        {
            "type": "GLEIF",
            "alias": "gleif-user-1",
            "identifiers": ["gleif-aid-1"]
        },
        {
            "type": "QVI",
            "alias": "qvi-user-1",
            "identifiers": ["qvi-aid-1"]
        },
        ...
    ]
    ```
    

### Customizing Configuration and Workflow Files

Users can create custom configurations by adding JSON configuration files in the `config` directory, specifying credential types, schemas, privacy settings, and agents. Custom workflows, added to the `workflow` directory as YAML files, enable users to define unique steps, credential sources, or verification processes for various use cases.

## Workflow Steps

The YAML file specifies each credential issuance step in the workflow, defining the issuer, issuee, credential type, and additional options. For example:

```yaml
ecr_cred2:
  id: "ecr_cred2"
  type: "issue_credential"
  attributes:
    personLegalName: "John Doe"
    LEI: "875500ELOZEL05BVXV37"
  issuer_aid: "le-aid-1"
  issuee_aid: "ecr-aid-1"
  description: "LE issues ECR vLEI credential"
  credential: "le_to_ecr_vlei_cred"
  credential_source: "le_cred"
  generate_test_data: true
  test_name: "3-user-check-upload-rev"
```

### Explanation of Parameters

*   **id**: Unique identifier for the step.
*   **type**: Defines the action, e.g., `issue_credential`.
*   **attributes**: Contains metadata for the credential.
*   **issuer_aid** & **issuee_aid**: Identifiers for the issuer and recipient.
*   **generate_test_data**: When set to `true`, this generates credential data JSON files for validation.
*   **test_name**: Specifies the directory name for saving test data.
    

### Test Data Generation

When `generate_test_data` is enabled, JSON files with test credential data are generated and saved in:

```bash
signify-ts-test/test/data/test_data/{test_name}
```

For example, data generated by the `ecr_cred2` step is located in `signify-ts-test/test/data/test_data/3-user-check-upload-rev`.

## Generated Credentials

*   **Test Data Directory**: JSON files are saved under `signify-ts-test/test/data/test_data/{test_name}`, based on the specified test name in each workflow step.
*   **The generated credential json file will contain the following data**:
  1. credential - this key will contain raw and CESR versions of the credential
  2. AID
  3. LEI
  4. engagementContextRole
    

## Final Step: Execute the Workflow with the Configuration

To run the workflow with your specified configuration, use the following command:

```bash
WORKFLOW=singlesig-single-user.yaml CONFIGURATION=configuration-singlesig-single-user.json ./test-workflow.sh --data-report-verify-proxy
```

This command sets the workflow and configuration files as environment variables, enabling you to customize and test different workflows and configurations.

## Additional Notes

This setup supports both single-signature (`singlesig`) and multi-signature (`multisig`) credential issuance. Configurations and workflows are available for both modes.
